# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 11, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started with revising the prior work I have done over the months. (Not much tho!)

**Thoughts:** Well begun is half done is I hope I can stay consistent on this journey. I have basic idea of coding, data structure and algorithm but to join them together I need to do it practically and consistency is the key so hope it works out.

### Day 1: December 12, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Converted while loop to for loop for "Check if list is sorted"

**Thoughts:** Spent several hours for something super basic. Was frustrating but I believe it will get better with time. Since today was Sunday so could put in several hours.

### Day 1: December 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Introduced to Github, tried coding some basic codes.

**Thoughts:** Was extremely tired and got a bit distracted, still don't feel my pace is good enough. But slow and steady wins the race.
