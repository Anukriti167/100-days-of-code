# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 11, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started with revising the prior work I have done over the months. (Not much tho!)

**Thoughts:** Well begun is half done is I hope I can stay consistent on this journey. I have basic idea of coding, data structure and algorithm but to join them together I need to do it practically and consistency is the key so hope it works out.

### Day 1: December 12, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Converted while loop to for loop for "Check if list is sorted"

**Thoughts:** Spent several hours for something super basic. Was frustrating but I believe it will get better with time. Since today was Sunday so could put in several hours.

### Day 2: December 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Introduced to Github, tried coding some basic codes.

**Thoughts:** Was extremely tired and got a bit distracted, still don't feel my pace is good enough. But slow and steady wins the race.

### Day 3: December 14, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Tried understanding Classes and Objects.

**Thoughts:** Went and read previous reference docs to get an idea.

### Day 4: December 15, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Working on the project (Tamagotchi Game)

**Thoughts:** Started building it with reference to Coursera, still not able to particularly gather how classes work. But trying to get the concept clear. 

**Note:** One of the interesting things I came across is we can access class variables using self. But if instance variable is present then we will be accessing the instance variable in place of the class variable since it has more precedence in that case. Also since it shadows the class variable.

### Day 5: December 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Working on the project (Tamagotchi Game) 2.0, wrote a code for arranging list of string alphabetically 

**Thoughts:** I went ahead and analysed the project to properly understand its working. Still long way to go before I get comfortable in classes. Today while trying to write the code for "arranging list of string alphabetically" I found a very unconventional solution and therefore it didn't get accepted as a valid answer in Coursera but the output was same. I'm happy I could come up with that solution on my own. Cheers to this nice feeling!

### Day 6: December 17, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on understanding Inheritance in classes.

**Thoughts:** I'm using Coursera course on "Python Classes and Inheritance" by University of Michigan for reference to understand the concept of classes. Still, not very comfortable yet with classes but trying to get used to it.

### Day 7: December 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Method Overriding

**Thoughts:** Not much, bit upset didn't put in the required amount of hours. Still understood the concept of Method Overriding.

**Note:**

## Day 8: December 19, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Done with the Coursera course (all that was needed for now)

**Thoughts:** Understood the concept of invoking of classes, Inheritance. Still finding it hard to solve the GFG problems. Will work on it more.  

**Note:** If you refer to super(), python takes care of looking up that in the parent class.

## Day 9: December 20, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Solved 4 GFG questions.

**Thoughts:** 1 of the questions I really struggled with maybe also because I had tried before and couldn't so wasn't feeling confident enough. Others I solved on my own. Also reviewed other correct solutions.

**Note:** The pop function for last element in the list takes O(n) time, which might lead to high time complexity.

**Work:** Array insert at index, Count Smaller Than X, Count Elements Greater Than X, Find Immediate Smaller Than X

## Day 10: December 21, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Solved 2 GFG questions.

**Thoughts:** I tend to implemet data structures like predominantly stack in my solutions way too much. Which tends to increase the time complexity of my solutions. Need to implemet basic solutions as well.

**Note:** 

**Work:** Who has the majority?, Find Immediate Greater Than X

## Day 11: December 22, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Solved 2 GFG questions.

**Thoughts:** Couldn't figure out the reason why code isn't working then consulted a friend to understand that because of the driver code. Going to work on it.

**Note:** 

**Work:** Maximum and Minimum In Array, Reverse The Array

## Day 12: December 23, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Couldn't resolve it

**Thoughts:** Worked on the question "Rotate Array", but couldn't get to the resolution.

**Note:** Interesting thing that I noticed about lists is that, if suppose N = 5 and D = 2 then suppose I use "for i in range(len(arr[D: N])):" even if I slice the list the "i" will start from 0 only and not function from 2 till 5 but if I use "for i in arr[D : N]:" then "i" will take values arr[D].  

**Work:**
